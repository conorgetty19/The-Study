# The Study

## Introduction

The Study is a React app that seeks to condense free, quality sources of information into one easy-to-use website. Users can upload links to, and access, lectures, podcasts, literature, and more. 

Regular users can update/edit their own uploads and access the external links found in the resource descriptions. Admins can edit any uploads. All users have a homepage that makes uploads searchable by title, description, and upload media (video, audio, text, mixed). It also gives links to uploads by Dewey Decimal category (Language, Science, Tech, etc.). Users can access a page of their uploads, with full search functionality.

## Purpose and motivation for project 

Youtube is filled with junk videos and distractions. Libraries require you to live in a particular area and their loans are temporary. Books in the public domain are often spread across the internet. The Study resolves these issues by acting as a digital library for free, quality learning resources.

Personally, I have a disorganized mess of bookmarks that all lead to an interesting an engaging subject. However, this information is not accessible due to the lack of structure. I wanted my React app to solve this problem for me and others like me.
